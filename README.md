# Smart-IR-Hub-Centralized-Control-for-TV-AC-and-Lighting
This project integrates infrared control for managing a television, air conditioner, and lighting system into a unified solution using a KY-022 IR receiver and an IR emitter based on an Arduino. By utilizing RAW signals captured from remote controls, the IR signals are transmitted to control the devices, and the IR signal strength is amplified with the help of a transistor to ensure greater operating range and improved coverage.

#This approach makes the project highly useful in environments where remote control of multiple devices is needed, providing an enhanced level of flexibility and efficiency in their operation without requiring a separate remote for each device.

#This centralized system significantly improves the user experience, saving time and resources through a simple, efficient, and scalable solution.
